abstract: This invention proposes a trajectory generation method based on quintic polynomials in the Cartesian coordinate system. The polynomial's coefficients are determined by boundary conditions, including position, velocity, and acceleration at the start and end points of the curve. The system focuses on generating smooth, continuous trajectories optimized for turning scenarios at intersections, where curvature plays a crucial role. A multi-decision maker and evaluator framework is introduced, which uses virtual speed sampling and curvature evaluations to dynamically generate optimal trajectories. An experience pool stores previous trajectory data to refine decision-making for future route planning.

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: This invention presents a method for generating adaptive trajectories using quintic polynomials, specifically designed for use in autonomous driving systems at intersections. By considering position, velocity, and acceleration at key points, the system creates optimized curves that ensure smooth transitions and efficient turning. A multi-decision maker and evaluator system dynamically adjusts virtual speeds and evaluates curvature to generate optimal trajectories, leveraging past experiences stored in a memory pool to improve future decisions and enhance overall driving performance.
