abstract: This invention addresses the challenges of integrating SOME/IP services in smart driving domains, including service abstraction and load balancing. The SOME/IP Service module abstracts the communication interfaces of vehicles' body domain, cockpit domain, and MCU, isolating the smart driving domain from hardware-specific variations. By mapping SOME/IP services to communication topics, the system simplifies communication, allowing applications to interact without needing to manage the SOME/IP protocol directly. Additionally, the invention supports message fusion, load-balanced processing, and flexible message transmission and forwarding modes, optimizing communication efficiency between the smart driving domain and other vehicle systems.

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: This invention introduces a SOME/IP Service module that abstracts and simplifies vehicle communication for smart driving systems. It maps SOME/IP services to topics, making communication more efficient and less dependent on vehicle-specific protocols. The system supports message fusion, load balancing, and both message passthrough and forwarding modes, allowing flexible and efficient interaction between different domains in the vehicle.
