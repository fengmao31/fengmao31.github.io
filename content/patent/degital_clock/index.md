abstract: This invention identifies digital clocks in both streamed and pulled videos using screen regions and screenshots. Image recognition is used to calculate time differences between the clocks, followed by simple outlier filtering and basic statistical analysis to measure latency. In later stages, OpenCV was integrated to automatically detect clock regions and improve image preprocessing. This enhanced the accuracy and efficiency of the system, leading to better overall performance in latency testing.

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: This invention focuses on a system for automatic latency testing in remote driving video streams. Utilizing digital clock recognition from screen regions and image processing techniques, it calculates the time differences between the streamed and pulled video streams. The integration of OpenCV for clock detection and image preprocessing has significantly enhanced software performance.
