By leveraging an SC2 vulnerability, a custom simulation platform was developed using the SC2 API. This platform allows for the creation of custom maps, buildings, and units, providing flexibility for various research and experimentation. Inspired by Tsinghua University's Clash Royale card RTS paper, which used SSD and card vectors for decision-making but did not account for unit strength and urgency along paths, this project introduces a new approach. In a custom map building RTS game within SC2, an RNN is used to encode unit formations along lanes and building option vectors as inputs, with DQN employed for strategic decision-making. 

This is Waiting to be implemented. Some jobs is done below.
