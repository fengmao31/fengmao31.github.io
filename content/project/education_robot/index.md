This project designs a state transition model for educational robots to manage complex multi-round interactions, particularly in the context of math tutoring. The model enables the robot to switch flexibly between different roles, such as assisting students, engaging parents, and following teacher guidance. By efficiently managing state transitions, the system enhances the robot's intelligence and interactive experience, while incorporating ethical considerations to ensure safety and effectiveness, especially for children.
