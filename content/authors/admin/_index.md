## About Me

I am a robotics researcher working toward cognitive autonomy—robots that not only act, but understand, adapt, and self-correct. I am currently building the first step with TIWM (Tokenized Intent World Model), a sparse intent-token interface between perception and decision-making. My long-term goal is to unify interpretable cognitive templates and autoregressive long-horizon planning into a hybrid paradigm for generalizable, human-aligned robotic intelligence.
