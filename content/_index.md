        - Sparse World Representation

        Learning minimal yet semantically grounded tokens from high-dimensional perception to replace dense world-model reconstruction and enable fuzzy-memory sparse alignment across scenes.

        - Cognitive Skill Templates

        Designing interpretable, composable action schemas (symbolic abstraction Ã— RL policy) for contextual reasoning, fast adaptation, and robust error recovery in dynamic humanâ€“robot interaction.

        - Intent Autoregression & Spatiotemporal Co-evolution

        Imagining future states via intent-token autoregression to support long-horizon, joint spatiotemporal planning without dense future rollouts.

      subtitle: ''
      text: |-

        A unified representationâ€“generationâ€“decision semantic loop that imagines futures and acts upon them with intent. TIWM provides an intent interface that fuses template-driven cognition with sparse AR long-horizon reasoning for scalable, interpretable planning.
