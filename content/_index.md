      subtitle: ''
      text: |-
        My research focuses on intelligent robotics and artificial intelligence, particularly in multi-agent decision-making and human-machine symbiosis scenarios. I am currently investigating the following areas:

        - Emergent Intelligence in Large Models and High-Dimensional Output Challenges

        While deep reinforcement learning excels at handling high-dimensional inputs, generating high-dimensional outputs remains a significant challenge. I am exploring whether emergent intelligence in large models can address this issue. Preliminary experiments show that large models can foster a degree of social cooperation among multiple agents, potentially providing a pathway to building AI systems with common-sense constraints and cooperative behavior.

        - Multi-Agent Cooperation and Decision-Making

        My research delves into the mechanisms of cooperation and decision-making in multi-agent systems within complex environments. By integrating large models, I aim to enhance the cooperation and efficiency of these systems. The focus is on leveraging social cooperation, distributed learning, and collaboration strategies to optimize the intelligence of multi-agent frameworks.

        - Human-Machine Symbiosis Paradigms
        
        I am also exploring how large models and reinforcement learning can incorporate human intuition, common sense, and social norms into AI systems to promote effective interaction and symbiosis between humans and machines. This research aims to support more robust AI performance in practical applications.
